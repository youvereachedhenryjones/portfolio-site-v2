            Most people don&apos;t pivot from running a precious metals business to
            leading backend engineering at a major media company. But most people
            don&apos;t build production systems that serve millions of readers daily,
            either.

            After a decade in strategic communications and business operations, I
            made a calculated bet during COVID: teach myself full-stack development
            through a <span className="tech-term">MERN</span> bootcamp, then get my hands dirty with real code. Three
            and a half years later, I&apos;m architecting <span className="tech-term">cloud infrastructure</span> and
            data pipelines at the Philadelphia Inquirer, designing systems that
            ingest, process, and serve content at scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            My unconventional path gives me something most engineers don&apos;t have:
            deep business context. I understand both the technical requirements and
            the strategic implications. Whether I&apos;m optimizing <span className="tech-term">database queries</span>,
            containerizing microservices, or building <span className="tech-term">ML pipelines</span>, I&apos;m solving
            problems with measurable outcomes: systems that cut costs, reduce latency, and ship on time.
          </p>
          <p className="text-cyberTeal font-medium">
            My focus now is data engineering and <span className="tech-term">AI/ML</span> infrastructure: building the pipelines, platforms, and systems that power intelligent applications.

              When I&apos;m not engineering systems, you&apos;ll find me on the mats
              training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, here with Professor Fred Silva at
              Lucas Lepri Jiu Jitsu Academy in Charlotte, NC. The discipline,
              problem-solving, and continuous improvement translate directly to
              how I approach code.
